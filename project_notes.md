## TODO
* Save out the conda env (niche_mix) 
* Send proj to HPC to start annotations
* Build WF script to separate the anlysis and plots from the annotation steps
* Put MOL downloader into .gitignore


## Activity log

|Date|Activity|
|:-|:------------|
|2021-11-02|Built directory/repo, importedbreezy template, imported niche functions script|
|2021-12-01|Simplifying approach...|
|2021-12-09|Modifying workflow, working with cranes and elephants, annos on HPC|

## Notes
*  Should be able to do this more simply than breezy-style or with mosey db.  Thus trying to build entire workflow as a single r script (calling a couple external function scripts)
