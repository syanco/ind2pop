## Notes
*  Should be able to do this more simply than breezy-style or with mosey db.  Thus trying to build entire workflow as a single r script (calling a couple external function scripts)

*No STOAT pre-annotations for trees....  Request batch?  Also, though, is FIA in mol.org? Might skip the plants

*Might try LST - WJ suggested that EVI may be particularity amenable to this...
